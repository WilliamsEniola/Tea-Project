    <li>Peach Cobbler Guayusa Tea</li>
   </h2>
   <img src="/project tea/peach-cobblers-iced-tea.jpg" alt="PCG Tea">
   <p style="width:50%">Guayusa (pronounce gwhy-you-sa) is a rare tea native to the Amazon Rainforest of Ecuador and is produced from the leaves
of a holly tree (ilex guayusa).
Due to it being heavily caffeinated it has an awakening effect similar to coffee. (Guayusa contains 90 mg of
caffeine/cup making it the second most caffeinated plant
on earth next to coffee).
It is available pure, or infused with a number of different flavor such as mint, chocolate or chai, however my favorite
is Peach Cobbler.
It has a scrumptious aroma of juicy peaches and spice. Guayusa tea contains 50% more anti-oxidants than green tea,
and has been found to balance the bodies pH and blood sugar levels, improve the functioning of the kidneys, improve
digestion and lower blood pressure.
Many people find drinking Guayusa both relaxing and stimulating at the same time!</p>

    <li>White Pearls White Tea</li>
</h2>
<img src="/project tea/White Pearls White Tea.jpg" width="60%" alt="WPTea">
<p style="width:50%">This white tea is comprised of 100% newly sprouted buds, hand-rolled into small pearls, that then gently unfurl when
infused.
White tea comes from a special strain of the tea plant and is harvested only a few days of the year and produced solely
in China,
mainly in the Fujian province.
It is difficult to obtain as production is extremely limited and therefore it is a very expensive and rare tea.
Its health benefits include reduced risk of cancer and cardiovascular disorders,
and it contains anti-aging properties which help in maintaining good health and healthy skin.
